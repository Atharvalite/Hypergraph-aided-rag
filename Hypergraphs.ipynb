For example, between 2021 and 2022, the labor market continued to improve, which may have affected private coverage in the United States during that time', '1 Public policy changes included the renewal of the Public Health Emergency, which allowed Medicaid enrollees to remain covered under the Continuous Enrollment Provision', '2 The American Rescue Plan (ARP) enhanced Marketplace premium subsidies for those with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty level as well as for unemployed people', '3In addition to national policies, individual states and the District of Columbia can affect health insurance coverage by making Marketplace or Medicaid more accessible and affordable. This variation may be more or less pronounced across states. Missouri and Oklahoma expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2022, leaving only twelve states without expanded Medicaid eligibility, primarily in the South and parts 1 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported increases in national employment from 2021 to 2022.

This brief uses the 2021 and 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates to exam-ine differences in health insurance coverage status and select subtypes (Medicaid, direct purchase, and employer-based) for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 25 most populous metro-politan areas (refer to the “What Is Health Insurance Coverage?” text box)', '7 It also examines year-to-year changes (2021 to 2022) across these geographies. 4 Note that for the purposes of this brief, we consider a state to have expanded Medicaid eligibility if it expanded eligibility on or before January 1st of that expansion year. For a state to have expanded Medicaid eligibility in 2022, it would have had to expand eligibility after January 1, 2021, but before January 1, 2022.

The  U.S. Census Bureau conducts the ACS throughout the year; the survey asks respondents to report their coverage at the time of interview. The resulting measure of health insurance coverage, therefore, reflects an annual average of current comprehensive health insurance coverage status.* This uninsured rate measures a different concept than the measure based on the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). For reporting purposes, the ACS broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private insurance or public insurance. The ACS defines private health insurance as a plan provided through an employer or a union, coverage purchased directly by an individual from an insurance company or through an exchange (such as healthcare', 'gov), or coverage through TRICARE. Public insurance coverage includes federal programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP), individual state health plans, and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program at the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the ACS, people are considered insured if they were covered by any of these types of health insurance at time of interview. People are considered uninsured if they were not covered by any of these types of health insurance at time of interview or if they only had coverage through the Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage is not considered comprehensive', '* Comprehensive health insurance covers basic health care needs. This definition excludes single-service plans, such as accident, disability, dental, vision, or prescription medicine plans.The large sample size of the ACS allows for an examination of the uninsured rate and coverage by type for subnational geographies.8Key Findings• In 2022, the uninsured rate varied from 2.4 percent in Massachusetts to 16.6 percent in Texas (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The District of Columbia was among the lowest with an uninsured rate of 2.9 percent, not statistically different from Massachusetts', '• Utah and North Dakota reported the highest rate of private cov -erage (78.4 percent) in 2022, while New Mexico had the low -est private coverage rate (54.4 percent) (Figure 3).9• Utah had the lowest rate of public coverage in 2022 (22.2 percent), and New Mexico had the highest (Figure 4). • Twenty-seven states had lower uninsured rates in 2022 com -pared with 2021. Maine was the only state whose uninsured rate increased (6.6 percent in 2022, up from 5.7 percent in 2021) (Figure 1 and Appendix Table B-1)', '• From 2021 to 2022, 13 states reported increases in public cov -erage, with only Rhode Island reporting a decrease of 2.2 percentage points (Appendix Table B-3)', '8 The Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC) is the leading source of national level estimates of health insurance coverage. For a comparison of ACS and CPS ASEC measures of health insurance coverage, refer to < www', 'census.gov/topics/health/health-insurance/guidance.html >', '9 Respondents may have more than one health insurance coverage type at the time of interview. As a result, adding the total number of people with private coverage and the total number with public coverage will sum to more than the total number with any coverage.• From 2021 to 2022, nine states reported increases in private coverage, while seven reported decreases (Appendix Table B-2). DIFFERENCES IN THE UNINSURED RATE BY STATE IN 2022In 2022, uninsured rates at the time of interview ranged across states from a low of 2.4 percent in Massachusetts to a high of 16.6 percent in Texas, compared to the national rate of 8.0 percent.10 Ten of the 15 states with uninsured 10 The uninsured rates in the District of Columbia and Massachusetts were not statistically different.rates above the national aver -age were states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility, and two of those 15 states, Oklahoma (11.7 percent) and Missouri (8.6 percent), had recently expanded Medicaid eligibility in 2022.11 Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia had an uninsured rate below the national average. 11 Between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2022, 38 states and the District of Columbia elected to expand Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. The 12 states that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA on or before January 1, 2021, included Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Unemployment rates in Minnesota (2.7 percent), New Hampshire (2.5 percent), North Dakota (2.1 per -cent), and Utah (2.3 percent) were lower than the national average of 3.6 percent.17Four of the five states with the highest private coverage rates had higher direct-purchase cov -erage rates than the national average of 13.9 percent in 2022. Direct-purchase coverage rates in those states were: Minnesota (16.2 percent), New Hampshire (15.3 percent), North Dakota (19.2 percent), and Utah (15.4 percent).18 This may be related to the cost of direct purchase plans.

For example, a report from the Department of Health and Human Services indicated that states that expand Medicaid eligibility have, on average, 7 percent lower ACA Marketplace premiums.20 In 2022, the private coverage rate for the group of states that expanded Medicaid eligibility was 67.9 per -cent, while the group of nonexpan -sion states had a private coverage rate of 65.6 percent (Appendix Table B-5)', 'PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE BY STATE IN 2022Public health insurance coverage may be obtained through Medicare (coverage for most people aged 65 or older or people with certain disabilities), Medicaid (coverage for those with low incomes or 19 The Kaiser Family Foundation analyzed monthly premium data for all tiers (bronze, silver, and gold) for a 40-year-old in each state and county, weighted by county plan selections.

The Urban Institute also found lower premiums among Medicaid expansion states.

As in 2021, New Mexico had the highest rate of public health insurance coverage at 51.2 per -cent, while Utah had the lowest rate at 22.2 percent (Figure 4 and Appendix Table B-3).21 While the public coverage was high in New Mexico, it had the lowest rate of private coverage rate in 2022, leav -ing it with an uninsured rate near the national average. Similarly, Utah’s low public coverage rate was offset by its relatively high pri -vate coverage, also resulting in an uninsured rate close to the national average. If a state expanded its Medicaid eligibility as part of the ACA, that may affect its public coverage rate. Examining expansion states as a group, the prevalence of public coverage in 2022 was 38.5 per -cent, 4.2 percentage points higher than nonexpansion states, at 34.3 percent (Appendix Table B-5). Medicaid coverage accounted for a portion of that difference. Medicaid coverage was 22.7 per -cent in the group of states that expanded Medicaid eligibility and 18.0 percent in the group of nonex -pansion states', 'CHANGES IN THE UNINSURED RATE BY STATE FROM 2021 TO 2022From 2021 to 2022, uninsured rates decreased across 27 states, while only Maine had an increase.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that Marketplace enrollment in the U.S. increased from 12.0 to 14.5 million people between 2021 to 2022.23 Many states with increases in direct-purchase coverage also showed increases in Marketplace enrollment of 22 percent or greater (based on CMS data), and many states with increases in employer-based coverage had decreases in unemployment rates.24For the seven states with declines in private coverage rates, two experienced decreases in employer-sponsored coverage (Appendix Table B-2).

This led to an increased public coverage rate for the nation overall at 37.2 percent in 2022. As with private cover -age, changes in the distribution of public coverage subtypes (e.g., Medicaid) may affect the overall public coverage rate. Rhode Island reported a decrease in public coverage of 2.2 percentage points, which was driven by a decrease in people reporting Medicaid (2.3 percentage points) (Figure 4 and Appendix Table B-3).26 Increases in public health insurance coverage ranged from 0.6 percentage points to 2.3 percentage points across states', 'At the time of interview, 21.2 percent of people were cov -ered through Medicaid in 2022.

Only two nonexpansion states experienced increases in public coverage in 2022 (Alabama and Georgia). As a group, states that expanded Medicaid eligibility may have increased Medicaid rates over time, but rates may also decrease in some years due to economic conditions.28 Between 2021 and 2022, the group of states that had expanded Medicaid eligibility saw an increase of 0.2 percentage points in Medicaid coverage, to 22.7 percent; however, there was no increase for the group of non -expansion states.29 The increase in public coverage, and by exten -sion Medicaid, was consistent with Medicaid enrollment, which has increased since 2020, as reported by CMS.3027 There was no statistical difference in the increase in the public coverage rate in Nebraska and Oklahoma between 2021 and 2022', '28 State Medicaid eligibility expansion status in 2022 is used to compare change between 2021 and 2022', '29 There was no statistically significant change among nonexpansion states from 2021 to 2022', '30 Data from the CMS showed that Medicaid enrollment continued to increase in 2022, following increases in 2020 and 2021.

The Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH, metropolitan area has a competi -tive ACA Marketplace, both states expanded Medicaid eligibility, and Massachusetts has an individual health insurance mandate, all of which may have contributed to the low rate.31 Among the most popu -lous metropolitan areas, the San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, CA, metropolitan area had the second-lowest uninsured rate, and has expanded its healthcare, both in the private and public markets, via its Medi-Cal system and Healthy San Francisco program for the uninsured.32 In May 2022, California expanded Medi-Cal to all adults 50 years or older, which also may contribute to the higher insured rates in this metropolitan area.33 By 31 John Holahan, Erik Wengle, and Claire O’Brien, “Marketplace Competition and Premiums, 2019–2022,” Urban Institute, April 2022, < www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/Marketplace%20Premiums%20and%20Competition%202019-22.pdf >; ACA Marketplace Participation Tracker 2015–2023, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, <www.rwjf.org/en/insights/our-research/interactives/aca-marketplace-participation-tracker.html >.

Public insurance coverage includes federal programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP), individual state health plans, and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program at the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the ACS, people are considered insured if they were covered by any of these types of health insurance at time of interview. People are considered uninsured if they were not covered by any of these types of health insurance at time of interview or if they only had coverage through the Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage is not considered comprehensive 2 U.S. Census BureauWHAT IS HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE?This brief presents state-level estimates of health insurance coverage using data from the American Community Survey (ACS). The  U.S. Census Bureau conducts the ACS throughout the year; the survey asks respondents to report their coverage at the time of interview. The resulting measure of health insurance coverage, therefore, reflects an annual average of current comprehensive health insurance coverage status.* This uninsured rate measures a different concept than the measure based on the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). For reporting purposes, the ACS broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private insurance or public insurance. The ACS defines private health insurance as a plan provided through an employer or a union, coverage purchased directly by an individual from an insurance company or through an exchange (such as healthcare  Public - عامة Page 9 of 27                                               Version: 2. 0                                                                                       DESB -RFP  Copyr i ght ( c)  2024  Aj m an M uni ci pal i t y  & Pl anni ng Depar t m ent .

This entail s the design, development, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of an Application Programming Interface (API) alongside an API development,  API gateway solution and integration technology referred to as ASAB.  ASAB is integral for augmenting MPDA's exist ing integration capabilities, both internally and externally. It encompasses various functionalities, including design, development, migration, execution, logging, routing, monitoring, and insights for applications that leverage APIs.     The primary object ives of this project include:   1. Improved Performance: MPDA aims to significantly enhance application performance to ensure a superior user experience and greater efficiency in overall MPDA business services.  2. Scalability: MPDA requires an ASAB solution capab le of accommodating future growth and increased demands for service connectivity with ease.  3. Security: Security is paramount. The new ASAB must feature robust, proven security measures to safeguard sensitive data and protect against cyber threats effectivel y. 4. Cost-Effectiveness: While pursuing technological excellence, MPDA is mindful of associated costs. The solution should offer value for investment in terms of both initial capital expenditure (CAPEX), ongoing operational expenditure (OPEX), and total cost  of ownership (TCO).  5. Vendor Dependency Avoidance: MPDA adopts a strategic approach aiming to decrease AM’s dependence on a single provider for its products and services.    MPDA invites qualified vendors to submit proposals for the ASAB project. We are seek ing experienced partners with a proven track record in delivering comprehensive solutions that align with our project goals and objectives. Your proposal should detail your technical expertise, implementation plan, methodologies for implementation and migr ation, delivery schedule, and pricing information.

In addition to the above management processes, we expected the project implementation activities to be managed based on MPDA release mana gement standards that comply with ISO 20000 standards.    “Release Management” is responsible for planning, building, testing, deploying and verification of all releases into the live environment.   Release management process including “but not limited to “ :  1. MPDA will provide UAT “Staging” and production environments.  2. Vendor to do the required health check on both “UAT  & Production” environments, in addition to provide all licensing requirements.  3. Preparing and configuring all users’  credentials on the UAT a nd Production environments  4. Vendor to provide QA report (functional, performance, security,  and usability) that comply with project quality criteria.   6 State and federal policies designed to increase public coverage may also affect the supply and demand for private coverage. As a result, a variety of changes in coverage rates are possible. This brief uses the 2021 and 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates to exam-ine differences in health insurance coverage status and select subtypes (Medicaid, direct purchase, and employer-based) for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 25 most populous metro-politan areas (refer to the “What Is Health Insurance Coverage?” text box) 9 Respondents may have more than one health insurance coverage type at the time of interview. As a result, adding the total number of people with private coverage and the total number with public coverage will sum to more than the total number with any coverage.• From 2021 to 2022, nine states reported increases in private coverage, while seven reported decreases (Appendix Table B-2). DIFFERENCES IN THE UNINSURED RATE BY STATE IN 2022In 2022, uninsured rates at the time of interview ranged across states from a low of 2.4 percent in Massachusetts to a high of 16.6 percent in Texas, compared to the national rate of 8.0 percent.10 Ten of the 15 states with uninsured 10 The uninsured rates in the District of Columbia and Massachusetts were not statistically different.rates above the national aver -age were states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility, and two of those 15 states, Oklahoma (11.7 percent) and Missouri (8.6 percent), had recently expanded Medicaid eligibility in 2022.11 Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia had an uninsured rate below the national average. 11 Between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2022, 38 states and the District of Columbia elected to expand Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. The 12 states that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA on or before January 1, 2021, included Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Public insurance coverage includes federal programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP), individual state health plans, and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program at the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the ACS, people are considered insured if they were covered by any of these types of health insurance at time of interview. People are considered uninsured if they were not covered by any of these types of health insurance at time of interview or if they only had coverage through the Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage is not considered comprehensive 2 U.S. Census BureauWHAT IS HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE?This brief presents state-level estimates of health insurance coverage using data from the American Community Survey (ACS). The  U.S. Census Bureau conducts the ACS throughout the year; the survey asks respondents to report their coverage at the time of interview. The resulting measure of health insurance coverage, therefore, reflects an annual average of current comprehensive health insurance coverage status.* This uninsured rate measures a different concept than the measure based on the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). For reporting purposes, the ACS broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private insurance or public insurance. The ACS defines private health insurance as a plan provided through an employer or a union, coverage purchased directly by an individual from an insurance company or through an exchange (such as healthcare  Public - عامة Page 9 of 27                                               Version: 2. 0                                                                                       DESB -RFP  Copyr i ght ( c)  2024  Aj m an M uni ci pal i t y  & Pl anni ng Depar t m ent .

This entail s the design, development, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of an Application Programming Interface (API) alongside an API development,  API gateway solution and integration technology referred to as ASAB.  ASAB is integral for augmenting MPDA's exist ing integration capabilities, both internally and externally. It encompasses various functionalities, including design, development, migration, execution, logging, routing, monitoring, and insights for applications that leverage APIs.     The primary object ives of this project include:   1. Improved Performance: MPDA aims to significantly enhance application performance to ensure a superior user experience and greater efficiency in overall MPDA business services.  2. Scalability: MPDA requires an ASAB solution capab le of accommodating future growth and increased demands for service connectivity with ease.  3. Security: Security is paramount. The new ASAB must feature robust, proven security measures to safeguard sensitive data and protect against cyber threats effectivel y. 4. Cost-Effectiveness: While pursuing technological excellence, MPDA is mindful of associated costs. The solution should offer value for investment in terms of both initial capital expenditure (CAPEX), ongoing operational expenditure (OPEX), and total cost  of ownership (TCO).  5. Vendor Dependency Avoidance: MPDA adopts a strategic approach aiming to decrease AM’s dependence on a single provider for its products and services.    MPDA invites qualified vendors to submit proposals for the ASAB project. We are seek ing experienced partners with a proven track record in delivering comprehensive solutions that align with our project goals and objectives. Your proposal should detail your technical expertise, implementation plan, methodologies for implementation and migr ation, delivery schedule, and pricing information.

In addition to the above management processes, we expected the project implementation activities to be managed based on MPDA release mana gement standards that comply with ISO 20000 standards.    “Release Management” is responsible for planning, building, testing, deploying and verification of all releases into the live environment.   Release management process including “but not limited to “ :  1. MPDA will provide UAT “Staging” and production environments.  2. Vendor to do the required health check on both “UAT  & Production” environments, in addition to provide all licensing requirements.  3. Preparing and configuring all users’  credentials on the UAT a nd Production environments  4. Vendor to provide QA report (functional, performance, security,  and usability) that comply with project quality criteria.   6 State and federal policies designed to increase public coverage may also affect the supply and demand for private coverage. As a result, a variety of changes in coverage rates are possible. This brief uses the 2021 and 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates to exam-ine differences in health insurance coverage status and select subtypes (Medicaid, direct purchase, and employer-based) for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 25 most populous metro-politan areas (refer to the “What Is Health Insurance Coverage?” text box) 9 Respondents may have more than one health insurance coverage type at the time of interview. As a result, adding the total number of people with private coverage and the total number with public coverage will sum to more than the total number with any coverage.• From 2021 to 2022, nine states reported increases in private coverage, while seven reported decreases (Appendix Table B-2). DIFFERENCES IN THE UNINSURED RATE BY STATE IN 2022In 2022, uninsured rates at the time of interview ranged across states from a low of 2.4 percent in Massachusetts to a high of 16.6 percent in Texas, compared to the national rate of 8.0 percent.10 Ten of the 15 states with uninsured 10 The uninsured rates in the District of Columbia and Massachusetts were not statistically different.rates above the national aver -age were states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility, and two of those 15 states, Oklahoma (11.7 percent) and Missouri (8.6 percent), had recently expanded Medicaid eligibility in 2022.11 Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia had an uninsured rate below the national average. 11 Between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2022, 38 states and the District of Columbia elected to expand Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. The 12 states that had not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA on or before January 1, 2021, included Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Another exception occurs when the processor pops its last window,allowing the kernel to reload the saved windows.)Mode switches can be quite fast on the SPARC. On a mode switch, the processor switches to a differentregister window. The kernel handler can then run, using the registers from the new window and notdisturbing the values stored in the interrupted process’s copy of its registers.

Of course, most applicationswill use the interface correctly! But errors in an application program must not crash thekernel, and a computer virus must not be able to use the system call interface to takecontrol of the kernel.

For fault tolerance, scale, and responsiveness, web sites areincreasingly implemented on distributed clusters of computers housed in one or more', 'Throughout this book, we will present various approaches to improving operating systemreliability and availability . In many cases, the abstractions may seem at first glance overlyrigid and formulaic. It is important to realize this is done on purpose! Only preciseabstractions provide a basis for constructing reliable and available systems', 'wait(processID)Pause until the child process has exited', 'This starts the handler software', 'Interrupt masking prevents interrupts from being delivered at inopportune times', 'This starts the handler software', 'Suppose further that everyone in the world were completely honest and trustworthy . Inother words, we need not consider fault isolation 5. The host kernel can then restore the state of the user process, running at user level,as if the guest OS had been able to return there directly  UNIX has a system call, naturally enough called wait, that pauses the parent until the childfinishes, crashes, or is terminated. Since the parent could have created many childprocesses, wait is parameterized with the process ID of the child. With wait, a shell cancreate a new process to perform some step of its instructions, and then pause for that stepto complete before proceeding to the next step. It would be hard to build a usable shellwithout wait wait(processID)Pause until the child process has exited Streamlining client-server communicationClient-server communication is a common pattern in many systems, and so one can ask: how can weimprove its performance? One step is to recognize that both the client and the server issue a writeimmediately followed by a read, to wait for the other side to reply; at the cost of adding a system call, thesecan be combined to eliminate two kernel crossings per round trip. Further, the client will always need to waitfor the server, so it makes sense for it to donate its processor to run the server code, reducing delay', 'Figure 3.8: Example code for a simple UNIX shell Figure  3.8 illustrates the code for the basic operation of a shell. The shell reads acommand line from the input, and it forks a process to execute that command. UNIX forkautomatically duplicates all open file descriptors in the parent, incrementing the kernel’ sreference counts for those descriptors, so the input and output of the child is the same asthe parent. The parent waits for the child to finish before it reads the next command toexecute', 'Second, underlying hardware changes will often trigger new work in operating systemdesign. The future of operating systems is also the future of hardware:Very large scale data centers.  Operating systems will need to coordinate thehundreds of thousands or even millions of computers in data centers to supportessential online services Very large scale multicore systems.  Computer architectures already contain severalprocessors per chip; this trend will continue, yielding systems with hundreds orpossibly even thousands of processors per machine 5. Suppose you were the instructor of a very large introductory programming class', 'Finally , although you can think of a user program as starting with a call to main, in fact thecompiler inserts one level of indirection. It puts a stub at the location in the process’ smemory where the kernel will jump when the process starts. The stub’ s job is to call mainand then, if main returns, to call exit — the system call to terminate the process. Withoutthe stub, a user program that returned from main would try to pop the return programcounter , and since there is no such address on the stack, the processor would startexecuting random code      start(arg1, arg2) {          main(arg1, arg2);  // Call program main.   A program can read its input from a file.  Likewise, by using dup2 to change thestdin file descriptor , the shell can cause the child to read its input from a file. In thestandard UNIX shell, this is signified with a “less than” symbol. Thus, “zork < solution\"plays the game “zork” with a list of instructions stored in the file “solution.”The output of one program can be the input to another program.  The shell canuse a pipe to connect two programs together , so that the output of one is the input ofanother . This is called a producer -consumer  relationship. For example, in the C-compiler , the output of the preprocessor is sent to the parser , and the output of theparser is sent to the code-generator and then to the assembler . In the standard UNIXshell, a pipe connecting two programs is signified by a “|” symbol, as in: “cpp file.c |cparse | cgen | as > file.o”. In this case the shell creates four separate child processes,each connected by pipes to its predecessor and successor . Each of the phases canrun in parallel, with the parent waiting for all of them to finish. Virtual machine device drivers.  To handle legacy device drivers, one approach thathas gained some traction is to run device driver code inside a guest operating systemrunning on a virtual machine, as shown in Figure 3.14. The guest operating systemloads the device drivers as if it was running directly on the real hardware, but when thedevices attempt to access the physical hardware, the underlying virtual machinemonitor regains control to ensure safety . Device drivers can still have bugs, but theycan only corrupt the guest operating system and not other applications running on theunderlying virtual machine monitor ', '1.3.1 Impact of T echnology T rends1981 1997 2014Factor (2014 /1981)Single processor speed(MIPS)1 200 2500 2.5 KCPUs per computer 1 1 10+ 10+Processor $ / MIP $100K $25 $0.20 500 KDRAM capacity (MiB) / $0.002 2 1K 500 KDisk capacity (GiB) / $ 0.003 7 25K 10 MHome Internet 300 bps 256 Kbps 20 Mbps 100 K In the meantime, while the processor is handling the interrupt, the device is idle Architectural support for fast mode switchesSome processor architectures are able to execute user- and kernel-mode switches very efficiently, whileother architectures are much slower at performing these switches User-level exception handling.  Earlier , we described a mechanism where processorexceptions, such as divide-by-zero errors, are handled by the kernel. However , manyapplications have their own exception handling routines, e.g., to ensure that files aresaved before the application shuts down. For this, the operating system needs toinform the application when it receives a processor exception so the applicationruntime, rather than the kernel, handles the event. Explicit close.  When an application is done with the device or file, it calls close. Thissignals to the operating system that it can decrement the reference-count on thedevice, and garbage collect any unused kernel data structures close(fileDescriptor)Tell the kernel the process is done with this file, channel, or device', 'It might seem like there was no need for an operating system in this setting. However ,since computers were enormously expensive, reducing the likelihood of programmer errorwas paramount. The first operating systems were developed as a way to reduce errors byproviding a standard set of common services. For example, early operating systemsprovided standard input/output (I/O) routines that each user could link into their programs Needless to say , this was an expensive operation, often scheduled for the dead of thenight For higher performance, the operating system sets up a circular queue of requests for each device tohandle. (A network interface will have two queues: one for incoming packets and one for outgoingpackets.) Each entry in the queue, called a buffer descriptor, specifies one I/O operation: the requestedoperation (e.g., disk read or write) and the location of the buffer to contain the data. The devicehardware reads the buffer descriptor to determine what operations to perform. Provided the queue ofbuffer descriptors is full, the device can start working on the next operation while the operating systemhandles with the previous one Buffer descriptors are stored in memory, accessed by the device using DMA (direct memory access) An implication is that each logical I/O operation can involve several DMA requests: one to downloadthe buffer descriptor from memory into the device, then to copy the data in or out, and then to store thesuccess/failure of the operation back into buffer descriptor', 'GET request. The web server decodes the packet, reads the file from disk, and sends thecontents of the file back over the network to the user ’s machine Figure 1.1: The operation of a web server. The client machine sends an HTTP GET request to the webserver. The server decodes the packet, reads the file, and sends the contents back to the client Nevertheless, an operating system can be, and should be, designed to minimize itsvulnerability to attack. For example, strong fault isolation can prevent third partyapplications from taking over the system. Downloading and installing a screen saver orother application should not provide a way for an attacker to surreptitiously install acomputer virus  on the system. A computer program that modifies an operating system orapplication to copy itself from computer to computer without the computer owner ’spermission or knowledge. Once installed on a computer , a virus often provides the attackercontrol over the system’ s resources or data. An example computer virus is a keylogger: aprogram that modifies the operating system to record every keystroke entered by the userand send them back to the attacker ’s machine. In this way , the attacker could gain accessto the user ’s passwords, bank account numbers, and other private information. Likewise, amalicious screen saver might surreptitiously scan the disk for files containing personalinformation or turn the system into an email spam server  c. Protecting the network from a virus trying to use your computer to send spam.', '3.2 Input/OutputComputer systems have a wide diversity of input and output devices: keyboard, mouse,disk, USB port, Ethernet, WiFi, display , hardware timer , microphone, camera,accelerometer , and GPS, to name a few  Replace file descriptor . By manipulating the file descriptors of the child process, theshell can cause the child to read its input from, or send its output to, a file or a pipeinstead of from a keyboard or to the screen. This way, the child process does not needto be aware of who is providing or consuming its I/O. The shell does this redirectionusing a special system call named dup2(from, to) that replaces the to file descriptorwith a copy of the from file descriptor  Because the commands to read and write to an open file descriptor are the same whetherthe file descriptor represents a keyboard, screen, file, device, or pipe, UNIX programs donot need to be aware of where their input is coming from, or where their output is going A program can send its output to a file. By changing the stdout file descriptor in thechild, the shell can redirect the child’ s output to a file. In the standard UNIX shell, thisis signified with a “greater than” symbol. Thus, “ls > tmp\" lists the contents of thecurrent directory into the file “tmp.” After the fork and before the exec, the shell canreplace the stdout file descriptor for the child using dup2. Because the parent hasbeen cloned, changing stdout for the child has no ef fect on the parent stdin and stdout in the child process with the pipe file descriptors; that is the role ofdup2', 'Alas, no useful computer is perfectly secure! Any complex piece of software has bugs, andseemingly innocuous bugs can be exploited by an attacker to gain control of the system Whether transitioning from user to kernel mode or in the opposite direction, care must betaken to ensure that a buggy or malicious user program cannot corrupt the kernel User programs cannot be allowed to jump to arbitrary locations in the kernel. Forexample, the kernel code for handling the read file system call first checks whether theuser program has permission to do so. If not, the kernel should return an error . Withoutlimited entry points into the kernel, a malicious program could jump immediately afterthe code to perform the check, allowing the program to access to anyone’ s file', 'Application and hardware designers spend their ef forts on those operating systemplatforms with the most users, while users favor those operating systems with the bestapplications or the cheapest hardware. If this sounds circular , it is! More users imply moreapplications and cheaper hardware; more applications and cheaper hardware imply moreusers, in a virtuous cycle Eventually , the cumulative ef fect of Moore’ s Law meant that the cost of computing droppedto where systems could be optimized for users rather than for ef ficient use of theprocessor . UNIX, for example, was developed in the early 70’ s on a spare computer thatno one was using at the time. UNIX became the basis for Apple’ s MacOS X, Linux,VMware (a widely used virtual machine monitor), and Google Android. Figure 1.9 tracesthe lineage of these operating systems Exercises1.

Moore’ s Law  states that transistor density increasesexponentially over time; similar exponential improvements have occurred in many othercomponent technologies. Figure 1.8 provides an overview of the past three decades oftechnology improvements in computer hardware. The cost of processing and memory hasdecreased by almost six orders of magnitude over this period; the cost of disk capacity hasdecreased by seven orders of magnitude.

A text editor can import an image created by a drawing program, andthe editor can in turn write an HTML file that a web server can read to know how todisplay a web page. A key distinction is that, unlike the first two modes,communication through the file system can be separated in time: the writer of the filedoes not need to be running at the same time as the file reader .

The database provides flexible and consistent lookups, suchas, which friends need to be notified of a particular update to a user’s Facebook wall.

Avoid defining a synchronized block in the middle of a method Any method declaration can include the keyword synchronized to indicate that theobject’ s lock is to be automatically acquired on entry to the method and automaticallyreleased on any return from the method. For example:   public synchronized foo() {       // Do something; lock is automatically acquired/released.   } This syntax is useful — it follows rule #2 above, and it frees the programmer fromhaving to worry about details, like making sure the lock is released before everypossible return point including exceptions. The pitfall is that Java also allows asynchronized block  in the middle of a method. For example:  public bar() {       // Do something without holding the lock       synchronized{           // Do something while holding the lock       }      // Do something without holding the lock   } This construct violates rule #3 from Section 5.5.2  and suf fers from the disadvantageslisted there. The solution is the same as discussed above: when you find yourselftempted to write a synchronized block in the middle of a Java method, treat that as astrong hint that you should define a separate method to more clearly encapsulate thelogical chunk you have identified The search method is read-only: after registering with readLock, it scans down the list untilit finds an element with a matching key . If the element is found, the method uses theparameter to return the value field and then returns TRUE. Otherwise, the method returnsFALSE to indicate that no matching record was found', 'This example demonstrates that acquiring and releasing a lock can be inexpensive Programmers often assume that acquiring a lock is an expensive operation, and thereforetry to reduce locking throughout their programs. The most likely result from prematureoptimization is a program that is buggy , hard to maintain, no faster than a cleanimplementation, and, ironically , harder to tune than a cleanly architected program. On mostplatforms, acquiring or releasing a lock is a highly tuned primitive — acquiring anuncontended lock is often nearly free. If there is contention, you probably needed the lock!In Section 6.3, we saw an example of synchronization without locks. RCU lets readsproceed without acquiring a lock or updating shared synchronization state, but it stillrequires updates to acquire locks. If the thread that holds the lock is interrupted, has a bugthat causes it to stop making progress, or becomes deadlocked, other threads can bedelayed for a long — perhaps unlimited — period of time', 'Software engineers use many of the same technologies and design patterns as those usedin operating systems to build other complex systems.

Aparticularly interesting example is in Google’s Chrome web browser. When the user clicks on a link, Chromeforks a process to fetch and render the web page at the link, in a new tab on the browser. The parentprocess continues to display the original referring web page, while the child process runs the same browser,but in its own address space and protection boundary. The motivation for this design is to isolate the newlink, so that if the web site is infected with a virus, it will not infect the rest of the browser.

Implement a simple Linux shell in C capable of executing a sequence of programs thatcommunicate through a pipe. For example, if the user types ls | wc, your programshould fork of f the two programs, which together will calculate the number of files inthe directory . For this, you will need to use several of the Linux system calls describedin this chapter: fork, exec, open, close, pipe, dup2, and wait. Note:  You will to replace',\n",

              " 'Likewise, they provide the illusion that each program has the computer ’s processorsentirely to itself. Obviously , the reality is quite different! These illusions let you writeapplications independently of the amount of physical memory on the system or thephysical number of processors. Because applications are written to a higher level ofabstraction, the operating system can invisibly change the amount of resourcesassigned to each application Figure 3.8: Example code for a simple UNIX shell A program can read its input from a file.  Likewise, by using dup2 to change thestdin file descriptor , the shell can cause the child to read its input from a file. In thestandard UNIX shell, this is signified with a “less than” symbol. Thus, “zork < solution\"plays the game “zork” with a list of instructions stored in the file “solution.”The output of one program can be the input to another program.  The shell canuse a pipe to connect two programs together , so that the output of one is the input ofanother . This is called a producer -consumer  relationship. For example, in the C-compiler , the output of the preprocessor is sent to the parser , and the output of theparser is sent to the code-generator and then to the assembler . In the standard UNIXshell, a pipe connecting two programs is signified by a “|” symbol, as in: “cpp file.c |cparse | cgen | as > file.o”. In this case the shell creates four separate child processes,each connected by pipes to its predecessor and successor . Each of the phases canrun in parallel, with the parent waiting for all of them to finish.',\n",

              " 'Now the good news: operating systems concepts are also among the most accessible incomputer science. Many topics in this book will seem familiar to you — if you have evertried to do two things at once, or picked the “wrong” line at a grocery store, or tried to keepa roommate or sibling from messing with your things, or succeeded at pulling of f an AprilFool’ s joke. Each of these activities has an analogue in operating systems. It is thisfamiliarity that gives us hope that we can explain how operating systems work in a singletextbook. All we assume of the reader is a basic understanding of the operation of acomputer and the ability to read pseudo-code up boundaries, an operating system must also allow those boundaries to be crossed incarefully controlled ways when the need arises Enforcement  is how the operating system ensures that only permitted actions are allowed The security policy  defines what is permitted — who is allowed to access what data, andwho can perform what operations User programs cannot be allowed to jump to arbitrary locations in the kernel. Forexample, the kernel code for handling the read file system call first checks whether theuser program has permission to do so. If not, the kernel should return an error . Withoutlimited entry points into the kernel, a malicious program could jump immediately afterthe code to perform the check, allowing the program to access to anyone’ s file',\n",
